# THE INSTRUCTION OF THE GEOMETRY DRAWER v0.0.3

### Welcome to use the Geometry Drawer by Harry_1391453181620 Developer Group
   This app is still in its first version, if there are any difficulties when using you can feed your comments in https://github.com/Harry-1391453181620.

### Main usages:
   - After you have entered all the functions to draw, and the app will print a coordinate system with x-axis and y-axis. The graph of the functions you entered will be plotted by scatter. 
   - When you move the mouse to the graph, you will find that there is a spot on the graph moving with your mouse.
   - The x and y positions of your mouse will be placed on the right-down corner of the screen and the position of the spot will replace the title 'Geometry Drawer'.
   - If you input:  draw line segment pointname1 (x, y), pointname2 (x, y) as line segment pointname1pointname2, the line segment will be drawn.
   - If you input:  draw line pointname1 (x, y), pointname2 (x, y) as line pointname1pointname2, the line will be drawn.
   - Tip: Unfortunately, because of the calculating error range of Python and the output on the screen is not really accurate.
   - Tip: mind the SPACES AND COMMAS when input ing the command to draw anything,  


### Input format (important)
   - This app ONLY accept these kinds of maths operators:
   "'+' '-' '*' '/' '**' '()' 'sqrt()'(replacing √) 'pi'(replacing π), sin(), cos(), tan(), cot(), sec(), csc(), log(), ln(), lg(), sinh(), cosh(), tanh(), sech(), csch(), sign(), versin(), exsec(), excsc()" Entre "exit" to print the graph. Additionally, small x MUST be in the inputs.
   - This app ONLY accept these commands:
     - draw line X (x, y), X (x, y) as line XX
   
### Expected errors
   - You may find that when using this app, package "lambdify" sometimes prints errors. Ignore them and kept entering.
   - You may find that ERROR "'int' is not callable" kept existing when inputting functions, ignore all of them.
